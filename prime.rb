1. Get int variable
2. Generate random integer less than int variable
3. Is greatest common divisor of random number and int 1?
4. If not 1, then they share a common factor and int variable is composite
5. If is 1, ask if random integer to the power of int variable - 1 mod int variable == 1?
6. If not, we have a witness int variable is composite
7. If yes, int variable is composite
